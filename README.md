## Running dartbot

* Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org)

* Navigate to dartbot folder and run using one of the following commands:  


		lein run

## Communicating with dartbot

Communicating with the dartbot is done either by broadcasting UDP messages or over websockets.

Connect using websockets at:

    ws://<ip>:8080/dartbot
    
If you don't know the IP, broadcast the following message on port 5000

    hello?

and the bot will reply with its IP on the same port.

After connecting, you will need to send an initial request message, in order to start receiving. Messages over websockets are JSON-strings.

    {"command" : "request", "get" : "all", "update" : "all"}

The "get" parameter defines what initial data is requested, and has the following options:
* __"all"__ - All current games will be returned.
* __"[gid123]"__ - Returns the game with the given ID.
* __"none"__ or option missing - no games returned.

The "update" parameter defeines what type of updates the client receives, and has the following options:
* __"all"__ - All full games are re-sent on each update.
* __"diff"__ - Only the difference between the old state and the new is sent on each update, has to be merged with the previous state client-side.
* __"messages"__ - messages sent to the robot are relayed to clients in this mode.
* __"none"__ or option missing - no updates are sent and the connection is closed.

## Messages
All of these messages can be sent to the bot to control it. The JSON/websocket messages are also sent to clients who have requested message updates.
